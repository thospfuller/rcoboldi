# Docker Examples

Below we include two examples for working with images in Docker along with a demonstration video showing the package in action.

## Using The RCOBOLDI RStudio Image On DockerHub

The RCOBOLDI [Rocker/RStudio image](https://hub.docker.com/r/thospfuller/rcoboldi-rocker-rstudio) is available on DockerHub. This image is built using dependencies which have been deployed in the Drat repository.

The RCOBOLDI [Rocker/Verse image](https://hub.docker.com/r/thospfuller/rcoboldi-rocker-verse) is a complete build using source code cloned from the GitHub repository.

The following is a fully working example based on the Rocker/RStudio image.

### From the command line:

```docker pull thospfuller/rcoboldi-rockstar-rstudio:[latest or 1.0.3 or some other tag]```

then

```docker image ls```

should show something like this:

> REPOSITORY                            TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
> thospfuller/rcoboldi-rockstar-rstudio   1.0.3             3f8c1c269940        37 minutes ago      2.42GB

then

```docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=password --name rstudio -i -t 3f8c1c269940```

### From the browser:

The next step is to test this in R so point your browser to [http://localhost:8787](http://localhost:8787) and use "rstudio" and "password" to login and then execute the following:

```
library(RCOBOLDI)
RCOBOLDI::Initialize()
result <- RCOBOLDI::ReadCopyBookAsDataFrame("/home/rstudio/rcoboldi/java/rcoboldi-core/src/test/resources/example1/DTAR020.cbl", "/home/rstudio/rcoboldi/java/rcoboldi-core/src/test/resources/example1/DTAR020.bin", "Fixed Length Binary", "cp037")
head(result)
```

## Building the RCOBOLDI RStudio Docker Image Locally

### Step 1.) Build the image (this can take up to 20 minutes).

```
docker build -t rcoboldi/rocker-rstudio:1.0.1 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thospfuller/rcoboldi/master/docker/rocker/rstudio/Dockerfile
[some image id]
```

### Step 2.) Launch a container based on this image.

```
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=password --name rstudio -i -t [some image id]
[some container id]
```

### Step 3.) Browse to http://localhost:8787 and enter the username & password combination rstudio & password.

The next three steps appear in the video.

Steps 4-7.) From the R CLI execute:
```
### Step 4.)
library(RCOBOLDI)

### Step 5.)
RCOBOLDI::Initialize()

### Step 6.)
result <- RCOBOLDI::ReadCopyBookAsDataFrame("DTAR020.cbl", "DTAR020.bin", "Fixed Length Binary", "cp037")

### Step 7.)
head(result)
```

## YouTube

If you're looking to load COBOL data files into the R Project for Statistical Computing then you came to the right place.

The Dockerfile in this example is based on Rocker / RStudio and will be running locally on port 8787.

Below is a video which demonstrates the R COBOL Data Integration package running in Docker.
